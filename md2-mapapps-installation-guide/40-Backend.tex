\subsection{Configure Eclipse to Manage GlassFish}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In Eclipse, open the Servers tab.
\item Right-click it and choose \enquote{New} $\rightarrow$ \enquote{Server}.
\item If the GlassFish adapter is not installed yet (look for \enquote{GlassFish} in the list of types), click \enquote{Download additional server adapters} and install the entry \enquote{GlassFish Tools}.
\item From the list of types, choose \enquote{GlassFish} $\rightarrow$ \enquote{GlassFish 4.0} and click \enquote{Next}.
% (in the next line, GlassFish is written with lowercase F on purpose! Field is actually named this way.)
\item For the Glassfish Server Directory field, navigate to the \texttt{glassfish/} directory of your installation. If you entered the correct path, it should output something similar to
	\begin{quotation}
	\enquote{Found GlassFish Server version 4.0.0}.
	\end{quotation}
	Otherwise, follow the assistant's hints.
\item Click \enquote{Finish}.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Start GlassFish and Add the Backend}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Within the GlassFish installation directory, navigate to \texttt{glassfish/bin/}.
\item Run the \texttt{asadmin} utility (Windows: Double-click on \texttt{asadmin.bat}, Linux/OS X: Open a terminal in that directory and run \texttt{./asadmin}).
\item In the GlassFish administration utility, type \texttt{start-database} to start the Derby database for the backend.
\item Start Eclipse and import the generated project \texttt{\textit{<PROJECT\_NAME>}.backend}.
\item In the Project Explorer tab, right-click the project in Eclipse, choose \enquote{Properties}, and navigate to \enquote{Targeted Runtime}.
\item Deselect all runtimes and click \enquote{Apply}.
\item Select the item \enquote{GlassFish 4.0} and click \enquote{Apply}.
