\begin{itemize}
	\item installation instructions,
	\item a guideline for building single Apps, providing information about the
	\begin{itemize}
		\item DSL and its language constructs,
		\item the process of model creation using \MD,
		\item as well as the code generation
		\item and the deployment process of the developed App,
	\end{itemize}
	\item information needed for the development of multiple Apps
	\item and information about more advanced additional functions of the language.
\end{itemize}

In general, the \MD framework provides the modeller with a way to generate a multitude of Apps and a corresponding Backend out of a single model source. Using eclipse as an IDE, convenient features, like the auto formatting of the model code by pressing STRG+SHIFT+F, can be used.
