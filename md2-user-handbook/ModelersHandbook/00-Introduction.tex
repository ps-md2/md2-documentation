This chapter represents the handbook for people who want to use the \MD framework for the development of applications. It consists of

\begin{itemize}
	\item installation instructions,
	\item a guideline for building single Apps, providing information about the
	\begin{itemize}
		\item DSL and its language constructs(cf. \ref{sec: Installation}),
		\item the process of model creation using \MD (cf. \ref{subsec:SingleAppDev}),
		\item as well as the code generation (cf. \ref{subsec:SingleAppDev}),
		\item and the deployment process of the developed App (cf. \ref{subsec:SingleAppDep}),
	\end{itemize}
	\item information needed for the development of multiple Apps (cf. \ref{sec:developAndDeployMultiApps})
	\item and information about more advanced additional features of the language (cf. \ref{sec:Additional Features}).
\end{itemize}

In general, the \MD framework provides the modeller with an understanding of how to generate a multitude of Apps and a corresponding Backend out of a single model source. Using eclipse as an IDE, convenient features, like the auto formatting of the model code by pressing STRG+SHIFT+F, can be used.
