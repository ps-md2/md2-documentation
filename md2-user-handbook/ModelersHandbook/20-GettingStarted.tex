\subsection{Creating a Project}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Initialize a new project by navigating to \lstinline[language=Simple]|File > New > Project...|. There, choose \lstinline[language=Simple]|Other > MD2 Project| and click \lstinline|Next|.
\item Choose a project name (note that it may not contain whitespace or other non-alphanumerical characters). If necessary, choose a location different from the proposed default.
\item After clicking on \lstinline|Finish|, a default project structure is generated which you can extend as you need.
\end{enumerate}

The created project contains the following folders:

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline[language=Simple]|src| contains the \MD models of your application and is initialized with a simple default. model.
\item \lstinline[language=Simple]|resources| contains resources that the generator will copy into the generated applications.
\item \lstinline[language=Simple]|src-gen| contains all artifacts that the generator derives from your model. This folder is organized by platform. For example, there is a folder for the backend and for \mapapps.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Developing a Single App} 
\label{subsec:SingleAppDev}
This section describes how an application can be developed based on the current (March 2015) state of the \MD DSL. To this end, it is structured according to the different layers that constitute a \MD model, which are shown in Figure \ref{fig:MD2Arch}. Aside from the conventional MVC layers -- model, view and controller -- the architecture includes an additional layer which enables the modelling as well as the generation of workflows within and across apps.

All components in \MD are organized in a package structure that represents the aforementioned structure. All documents have to be placed in corresponding packages (views, models, controllers or workflow). For example, all view files are expected to be in the package any.project.package.views. The package has to be defined in each \MD file as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
package PACKAGE_NAME
\end{lstlisting}
The package name has to be a fully qualified name that reflects the actual folder structure.

\subsubsection{map.apps} 
\label{subsubsec:mapapps}

You have two alternatives for deploying a \mapapps app into your NetBeans development environment:
\begin{itemize}
\item Copy it into the \lstinline[language=Simple]|src/main/js/app/| directory of the project, or
\item use a symbolic link to reference apps from another location (see \Cref{subsec:link-apps}).
\end{itemize} 

An additional benefit of the last alternative is that newly generated code, that results from changes to your model, will automatically be pushed to the \mapapps development environment. If the server is running there, the code will also be deployed to the server automatically.
