\subsection{Developing a Single App} 
\label{subsec:SingleAppDev}
In this section it is described how an application can be developed based on the current (March 2015) state of the MD2 DSL. To this end, this section is structured according to the different layers which constitute \MD model and are represented in Figure \ref{fig:MD2Arch}. Aside from the conventional MVC layers -- model, view and controller -- this includes an additional layer, which enables and models the generation of workflows within and across apps and was established during the project seminar.

All components in \MD are organized in a package structure that represents the aforementioned structure. All documents have to be placed in corresponding packages (views, models, controllers or workflow). For example, all view files are expected to be in the package any.project.package.views. The package has to be defined in each \MD file as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
package PACKAGE_NAME
\end{lstlisting}
The package name has to be a fully qualified name that reflects the actual folder structure.
