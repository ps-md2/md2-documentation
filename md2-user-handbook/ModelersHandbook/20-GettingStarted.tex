\subsection{Creating a Project}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Initialize a new project by navigating to \lstinline[language=Simple]|File > New > Project...|. There, choose \lstinline[language=Simple]|Other > MD2 Project| and click \lstinline|Next|.
\item Choose a project name that does not contain whitespace or other non-alphanumerical characters. If necessary, choose a location different from the proposed default.
\item After clicking on \lstinline|Finish|, a default project structure is generated which you can extend as you need.
\end{enumerate}

The new project contains the following folders:

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline[language=Simple]|src/| contains the \MD models of your application and is initialized with a simple default model.
\item \lstinline[language=Simple]|resources/| contains resources that the generator will copy into the generated applications.
\item \lstinline[language=Simple]|src-gen/| contains all artifacts that the generator derives from your model. This folder will contain multiple subfolder for different platforms. For example, there might be a folder for the backend and for \mapapps. Note, that everything in this directory will be overwritten when the generator is run.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Developing a Single App} 
\label{subsec:SingleAppDev}
This section describes how an application can be developed based on the current (March 2015) state of the \MD DSL. At its core, \MD is structured according to the MVC-pattern. MVC stands for Model-View-Controller and ensures the principle of single responsibility for these classes. In order to enable the modelling and generation of worklows within across apps in \MD, this architecture was extended to include an additional layer, the workflow layer (cf. \Cref{fig:MD2Arch}).

	\node[redbox, below = of wf] (ctrl) {Controller};
	\node[redbox, below left = of ctrl] (model) {Model};

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Architecture of \MD models}
\label{fig:MD2Arch}
\end{figure}

All components in \MD are organized in a package structure that corresponds to the aforementioned structure. Documents have to be placed in these packages (views, models, controllers or workflow). For example, all view files are expected to be in the package \lstinline[language=Simple]|any.project.package.views|. In every \MD file the package has to be defined as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
package PACKAGE_NAME
\end{lstlisting}
The package name has to be a fully qualified name that reflects the actual folder structure.

\subsection{Deploying a Single App}
\label{subsec:SingleAppDep}

\subsubsection{Backend} 
\label{subsubsec:Backend}

	The following steps will start the GlassFish server that is used for deploying the backend.
	Therefore, please grant all privileges that your firewall asks for, if any, so that the server can be accessed.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Within the GlassFish installation directory, navigate to \lstinline[language=Simple]|glassfish/bin/|.
\item Run the \lstinline[language=Simple]|asadmin| utility (Windows: Double-click on \lstinline[language=Simple]|asadmin.bat|, Linux/OS X: Open a terminal in that directory and run \lstinline[language=Simple]|./asadmin|).
\item In the GlassFish administration utility, type \lstinline[language=Simple]|start-database| to start the Derby database for the backend.
\item Start Eclipse and import the generated project \lstinline[language=Simple]|<PROJECT_NAME>.backend| by choosing \enquote{General} $\rightarrow$ \enquote{Existing Projects into Workspace} in the import wizard.
\item In the Project Explorer tab, right-click the project in Eclipse, choose \enquote{Properties}, and navigate to \enquote{Targeted Runtime}.
\item Deselect all runtimes and click \enquote{Apply}.
\item Select the item \enquote{GlassFish 4.0} and click \enquote{Apply}.
\item Correct JRE-related build path problems, if any, by resorting to the default JRE.
\item Confirm by clicking \enquote{OK}.
\item In the Servers tab, right-click the \enquote{GlassFish 4.0} entry, and choose \enquote{Add/Remove}.
\item Add the backend project to the server.
\item Start the server.
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{\mapapps} 
\label{subsubsec:mapapps}

You have two alternatives for deploying a \mapapps app into your NetBeans development environment:
\begin{itemize}
\item Copy it into the \lstinline[language=Simple]|src/main/js/app/| directory of the project, or
\item use a symbolic link to reference apps from another location (see \Cref{subsec:link-apps}).
\end{itemize} 

An additional benefit of the last alternative is that newly generated code, that results from changes to your model, will automatically be pushed to the \mapapps development environment. If the server is running there, the code will also be deployed to the server automatically.
