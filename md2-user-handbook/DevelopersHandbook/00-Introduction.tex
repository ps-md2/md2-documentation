\todo{@ALL review pls}

The goal of this chapter is to provide the reader with the detailed information necessary for the further development of the \MD framework. It includes the required information about the 

\begin{itemize}
	\item installation procedure,
	\item DSL Semantics,
	\item structure of the \mapapps and backend implementation
	\item and  gives insights about the structure and interaction of the generated and static code.
\end{itemize}

In addition, it is also noteworthy that while further developing the framework, the development process should consider that changes within the DSL might also have a direct effect on validators and the formatter. This should be kept in mind during the planning and implementation of future changes.
