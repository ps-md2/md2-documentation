The current implementation of the \MD framework generates web-based apps for a framework called map.apps, which is mainly based on JavaScript. Code generation of Android and iOS apps are also targeted, but not fully implemented yet.

The generated code for \mapapps can be subdivided into three parts: static \mapapps code, dynamically generated \mapapps code and a backend. The static \mapapps code contains the part of the code which does not depend on the models created in the \MD DSL. Since it is static, it does not need to be generated, but is required for the overall functionality of the generated apps. The dynamically generated part is completely dependent on the model. The backend is implemented in Java and contains static as well as dynamic code. However, it is completely generated. The backend provides a server which offers functionality such as data storage and communication accross apps.

Each of these three parts of the code is described in detail in the following.

\subsection{Static \mapapps Implementation}

The static \mapapps code is split into several bundles, which are then used by the generated \mapapps code. These bundles are located at \lstinline!src/main/js/bundles!\todo{Keywords nur highlighten wenn freigestellt} and are explained in the following subsections.

\subsubsection{Form controls}

The form controls are defined within the bundle \lstinline!md2_formcontrols!. It uses and extends the existing \mapapps bundle \lstinline|dataform| with additional form elements, which can be used in \MD. Each factory defined within the bundle of \MD, specifies how a JavaScript-object can be transformed to a data form widget. To define an own dataform or to understand the concepts of a dataform component the \href{http://developernetwork.conterra.de/documentation/31/developers/dataform}{\mapapps documentation} will be helpful.

\begin{description}
	\item[DateTimeBoxFactory] Defines a form control for the component \lstinline|DateTimeInput|, which is identified by the keyword \lstinline|datetimebox|. The widget shows a view element showing the time and the date of a \lstinline|datetime| value.
	\item[GridPanelFactory] Defines a form control for the component \lstinline|GridLayoutPane|, which is identified by the keywords \lstinline|md2gridpanel| and \lstinline|gridpanel|. The widget enables to structure multiple view elements in a grid.
	\item[ImageFactory] Defines a form control for the component \lstinline|Image|, which is identified by the keyword \lstinline|image|. The widget is able to display a static image within your app.
	\item[SpacerFactory] Defines a form control for the component \lstinline|Spacer|, which is identified by the keyword \lstinline|spacer|. A spacer defines some white space between some components or within the grid of a \lstinline|GridLayoutPane|.
	\item[StackContainerFactory] Defines a form control for the component \lstinline|AlternativesPane|, which is identified by the keyword \lstinline|stackcontainer|. This widget encapsulates the stackcontainer within \href{http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.10/dijit/layout/StackContainer.html}{\lstinline|dijit/layout/StackContainer|}. It provides a view elements which has multiple views, but shows only one, similar to a book or a slide show. The user can navigate between them using specific keys. 
	\item[TextOutputFactory] Defines a form control for the component \lstinline|Label|, which is identified by the keyword \lstinline|textoutput|. This widget enables to display uneditable text.
	\item[TooltipFactory] Defines a form control for the component \lstinline|Tooltip|, which is identified by the keyword \lstinline|tooltipicon|. This widget offers a tooltip behind a question mark icon.
	\item[UploadImageOutputFactory] Defines a form control for the component \lstinline|UploadedImageOutput|, which is identified by the keyword \lstinline|uploadimageoutput|. The widget is able to display an image within your app, which is uploaded/specified by the user. 
\end{description}

Special dataform elements enable the use of uploaded files. The \lstinline|UploadedImageOutput| displays image which have been uploaded by an app's user using a \lstinline|FileUpload| input element. Given that both elements are mapped to an entity's attribute of type \lstinline|file|, these elements retrieve an image from, or store an image on the server, respectively. For this procedure, a specialised \lstinline|remoteConnection| needs to be defined by the modeller, thus defining the remote location of this service and a local path where this service is able to store files (\lstinline|fileUploadConnection|). Consequently, this remote connection can be different from every other remote connection used e.g.\ by content providers.

\begin{figure}[b!]
\centering % trim=l b r t
\includegraphics[clip,  trim=0 17.4cm 3.cm 0, scale=0.8]{Fig/upload-sequence.pdf}
\caption{Procedure of uploading and retrieving user-uploaded images}
\label{fig:remoteFileUpload}
\end{figure}

As a further consequence, the uploaded file is not directly stored in the database. Instead, when called by a \lstinline|FileUpload| element, the upload service stores the file on disk at the specified path (\lstinline|storagePath|) and returns an identifier string of this file to the calling client (\Cref{fig:remoteFileUpload}, step 1).
This identifier is then used throughout the model, particularly as the value of a corresponding attribute of type \lstinline|file|  (\Cref{fig:remoteFileUpload}, step 2).

When such an identifier is encountered as the value of an \lstinline|UploadedImageOutput|, this element calls a servlet at the \lstinline|fileUploadConnection|, passing the identifier as a parameter (\Cref{fig:remoteFileUpload}, step 4). That way, the image is downloaded for the client just as soon as it is needed, instead of loading it at every initialisation of entities by a content provider. Note that currently only JPEG images should be uploaded, since the servlet always tries to output any given file using the content type \lstinline|image/jpeg|.



\subsubsection{List of open issues}
\label{sec:listOfOpenIssues}

The \lstinline!md2_list_of_open_issues! comprises all code necessary for displaying the list of open issues within the app. This list shows all workflow instances, whose state is at a workflow element, which belongs to the current app. Currently supported data listed in this widget are the guid of the workflow instance, the workflow element name and the last fired event. 
The list is included as \lstinline!dijit_Widget! and is listed as a \texttt{Tool} within the app.json under the bundle specifications of \lstinline!toolset!. In the \lstinline!ListOfOpenIssuesController! a \lstinline!DataView! is created, which uses the workflow store as a \lstinline!DataViewModel!. The workflow store is described in \cref{workflow_store}.
In addition to just displaying the workflow instances it is possible to start the workflow element through clicking on the respective entry. Therefore the \lstinline!ListOfOpenIssuesController! handles the event \lstinline!onClicked! and calls the function \lstinline!startWorkflow! of the respective \lstinline!MD2MainWidget!.

\subsubsection{Local store} \label{local_store}



The local store within the bundle \lstinline|md2_local_store| is one of three stores used in the context of \mapapps within \MD. This store implements some of the guidelines from the \lstinline|dojo/Store| interface, which means, that it offers the methods \lstinline|query|, \lstinline|get|, \lstinline|put|, \lstinline|add|, and \lstinline|remove|.
The local store can be used by a content provider (set to local within the controller model). This store saves all data as cookies in the browser. Thus the store is not meant for consistent data storage.

\paragraph{MD2MainWidget}
Each workflow element (see \ref{sec:developAndDeployMultiApps}) has its own instance of a \MD main widget. This is specified in the respective controller of the workflow element bundle inside the app. That is, the \lstinline!manifest.json! of the workflow element bundle references an \lstinline!_md2AppWidget! for its controller. Once the controller is activated (i.e. the \lstinline!activate! function is called), the respective \MD main widget instance is built. This \MD main widget is implemented in the file \lstinline!MD2MainWidget!, which serves as the basic starting point to start a workflow. Thus, it provides methods to start a workflow element. There are different ways a workflow can be started. One way is to start it directly from the map.apps tool bar. Another way is to start a workflow from the list of open issues (see section \ref{sec:listOfOpenIssues}). Figure~\ref{fig:InitMD2MainWidget} depicts this initialization process.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Initialization of the \MD main widget in order to start a workflow}
\label{fig:InitMD2MainWidget}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Workflow}\todo{Erlaeuterung der transactionID im WorkflowStateHandler + Erlaeuterung vom WorkflowStateTransaction.js fehlt noch...}
For each started workflow instance an unique ID is generated and assigned to that instance. This is done in the method \lstinline!startWorfklow! of the \lstinline!MD2MainWidget!. A global \lstinline!WorkflowStateHandler! provides methods to set and get the currently active workflow instance ID. This information is needed to suspend a workflow and to resume that workflow at a later time.

\paragraph{Actions}
Each action that is defined in the \MD DSL must also exist in the \MD runtime bundle in map.apps to be used. Individual actions are stored in the subfolder \lstinline!simpleactions!. Moreover, an \lstinline!ActionFactory! must provide a simple method that returns an instance of the respective action (e.g., \lstinline!getLocationAction! for the \lstinline!LocationAction!). All actions provide a method \lstinline!execute! that implements the action. An individual constructor allows to initialize the action, e.g., setting the city's name for a \lstinline!LocationAction!. The \lstinline!ActionFactory! is instanced in the method \lstinline!build! of the \lstinline!MD2MainWidget! (see figure~\ref{fig:InitMD2MainWidget}). Thus, every workflow element can access and use this factory.

\subsubsection{Store}\label{store}

The \lstinline|md2_store| bundle provides the second of the three stores. It could also be called remote store, since it provides access to external data storage. It is again an implementation of the \lstinline|dojo/Store| through implementing the necessary functions. The store is used within a content provider to query the current state of the objects belonging to the current workflow instance. In contrast to the local store, data which is saved within this store is persisted throughout the whole application landscape. For this purpose each store needs to be provided with an url, pointing to the respective backend server. The data is then queried and stored using rest web services. One implementation of such a backend is automatically generated by the backend generator described in \todo{Reference Backend ggenerator}. For the store to be able to find its respective backend the urls need to match each other (see \cref{subsubsec:Backend}). 

\subsubsection{Workflow store} \label{workflow_store}

The workflow store within \lstinline|md2_workflow_store| differs from the other stores provided by the static bundles. While the local (\cref{local_store} the remote store (\cref{store}) are used within a content provider the workflow store has its own purposes. This store is used to save and query the status of all workflow instances. On the one side it is injected in the \lstinline|WorkflowStateTransaction| of the \lstinline|md2_runtime| bundle (\todo{insert ref to subbundle}). There it is responsible of informing the backend of an change within the workflow instance. In the model this action can be represented by the \lstinline|FireEventAction|. Beside the information which event has been fired and which was the current workflow element and instance id, the backend get a list of all ids registered in the content providers. This is necessary to be able to restore the state of the content providers in another app.

On the other hand the workflow store is referenced in the list of open issues. The workflow store implements, same as the other, the functions of the \lstinline|dojo/Store|. Through this it is possible to hand the workflow store over to a \lstinline|DataView|, which then displays the information retrieved from the store.

\subsection{Dynamic map.apps implementation} \todo{Maybe join this with the \enquote{map.apps Generator} section}

\subsection{Backend} \todo{as part of map.apps? I'd suggest to move this into its own section -- Jan}



\section{Backend}\todo{Das hier in extra .tex Datei auslagern, weil jetzt extra section??}

The \MD backend is implemented in Java. It is generated by the \MD framework from the \MD model. Some code in the backend is static, though. 

\subsection{Beans}
For entities that are used in at least one remote content provider a stateless session bean is generated. Such a bean provides basic methods to create or manipulate entities of that bean. JPA is used for the persistent storage of the data. The persistence configuration file is located at \lstinline|META-INF/persistence.xml|. Currently, EclipseLink as persistence service.

Additionally, a static session bean is generated for the workflow state of the instances of a workflow. Internally, a workflow instance is identified by an identification number that is represented as an integer. However, since a workflow instance is generated at the client side, a single client cannot assure that a specific number is not used by another workflow instance of another client. Therefore, every client generates its own \lstinline|instanceId| that is a hash value of the current time (among others), and thus a quite likely unique identification value. This generated hash value is represented as a string value.

\subsection{Datatypes}
The datatypes used in the backend are static and implemented as simple wrappers. For instance, every entity has a unique internal identification number (\lstinline|internalID|) that is an integer value. The respective wrapper implementation is depicted in the following listing. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MD2, label=lst:intIdWrapper, caption=An integer wrapper for the internal identification number]
@XmlRootElement(name = "internalId")
public class InternalIdWrapper {
	
	@XmlElement
	protected int __internalId;
	
	protected InternalIdWrapper() {
		// no-arg default constructor necessary
	}
	
	public InternalIdWrapper(int integer) {
		this.__internalId = integer;
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Entities}
The entities and enumerations defined in the \MD model are generated into the subpackage \lstinline|entities.models|. Moreover, two static Java classes are generated:  \lstinline|RequestDTO| and \lstinline|WorkflowState|. The former is used as an encapsulation for all client requests, e.g., to create a corresponding REST request. The latter is used as a representation of the state an instance of a workflow has. A workflow can consist of multiple workflow elements, that in turn can fire different events. Thus, every started workflow (i.e. every workflow instance) must keep track of its current workflow element and the last fired event in it.

\subsection{Filedownload}\todo{Please give me a description...}

\subsection{Webservices}
Similar to the generation of the stateless session beans, a webservice is only generated for those entities that are used in at least one remote content provider. Those webservice provide a simple access to the entity data.

Additionally, some static webservice are generated that are used for specific features. Those webservices are explained in the following.
\subsubsection{Call external websevice}
As a simple way to interact with external services, a webservice \lstinline|CallExternalWebServiceWS| in the backend allows to call another webservice, that might be on a different system or server. The webservice in the backend provides a method that takes a JSON-encoded object as an input. This object must contain the URL, the REST method type and the set of parameters of that method. For example, the following listing depicts how such a JSON object is constructed in map.apps.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MD2, label=lst:callExtWSJSON, caption=JSON-encoded object containing information to call an external webservice]
data: json.stringify({
  "url": this._url,
  "requestMethod": this._method,
  "queryParams": this._queryParams,
  "body": this._bodyParams
})
\end{lstlisting}
